# Kenya-agriculture-analaysis-in-counties
In this project, I examined various types of agriculture performed in Kenyan counties in order to discover insights and their interrelationships as per the 2019 populatin census.

**Objectives.**
The following goals will be achieved by the analysis of the dataset that will be used for the complete project:
- Check the correlation between different types of animal farming practiced to make assumptions on its relation to number of households.
- Checking the ideal parameters for setting up agricultural exhibitions and to train farmers in industrial farming practices for differnt types of farming.
- Evaluate the range of agricultural practices practiced in gazetted forest areas.

Tools used: *Python ,jupyter notebook*
